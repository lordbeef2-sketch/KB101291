### Common Pilot Error in OFDM Standards

Common Pilot Error (CPE) represents the following imperfections that affect
 demodulation:

- Amplitude jitter across time
- Residual Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) caused due to close-in phase noise of the
 system

OFDM signals for WLAN transmit the pilot subcarriers with a known data sequence. This
 information is used to determine the error, in amplitude and phase, between an ideal
 signal and the received signal. This error data, known as CPE, is used to correct
 imperfections on both the pilot subcarriers and the data subcarriers. This correction
 results in more accurate demodulation.

Estimation and correction of the phase error component in CPE is mandatory in the
 Transmitter Modulation Accuracy (Error Vector Magnitude) Test as defined in sections
 17.3.9.8, 19.3.18.7.4, and 21.3.17.4.4 of *IEEE Standard 802.11-2016*,
 section 27.3.18.4.4 of *IEEE Standard P802.11ax/D8.0*, section 36.3.20.4.4 of
 *IEEE Standard P802.11be/D7.0* and section 38.3.25.4.3 of *IEEE
 Standard P802.11bn/D1.3*.

Note

The following figure describes the procedure to compute CPE.

[IMAGE alt='Procedure to compute the Common Pilot Error (CPE)' src='GUID-39CDD81A-4AB7-4AD8-BCF5-2C554D36E9B9-a5.png']

You can obtain the CPE for the received pilot subcarrier by correlating the received
 pilot subcarrier with its ideal value.

The CPE for symbol l is as follows.

[IMAGE alt='image' src='GUID-AFD4F1DA-CDFB-41E8-9BF9-AD99DE645B17-a5.png']

Where the values are the following.

- Amp(.) represents the amplitude component of a complex signal.
- Ph(.) represents the phase component of a complex signal.
- k is the pilot subcarrier index.
- M is the number of pilot subcarriers.
- X(k) is the received pilot subcarrier at index k.
- X I (k) is the ideal pilot subcarrier at index k.

If CPE tracking is enabled (Amplitude Tracking Enabled and
 Phase Tracking Enabled properties), all subcarriers are
 reduced by the amplitude error δ<sub>l</sub> and de-rotated by the phase error
 ∅<sub>l</sub>, for each symbol. The corrected subcarrier for symbol l is given by

### DSSS ModAcc Measurements

RFmx WLAN supports measurement of the modulation accuracy on signals conforming to the
 DSSS PHY defined in section 15 and the High Rate DSSS PHY defined in section 16 of
 *IEEE Standard 802.11-2016*. The standard calls for EVM computation only
 on the differential quadrature phase-shift keying (DQPSK) signal. However, DSSS ModAcc
 measurement computes the EVM for all data rates and modulation schemes defined in the
 above sections.

Along with sections 15.4.5.10/16.3.7.9 of *IEEE Standard 802.11-2016*, RFmx WLAN
 also conforms to sections 18.4.7.8 of *IEEE Standard 802.11b-1999* and
 18.4.7.8 of *IEEE Standard 802.11-2007* to compute the EVM.

First, the deviation V(n) of the amplitude of the n<sup>th</sup> chip from the mean amplitude
 of the packet is calculated as

[IMAGE alt='image' src='GUID-C8F6D728-4F52-4AE7-9654-CC6A0C1C2166-a5.png']

where

- X I (n) is the in-phase component of the received signal after removal of
 impairment,
- X Q (n) is the quadrature phase component of the received signal after
 removal of impairment,
- E is the expectation operator, and
- n is the chip index with a range of 0 ≤ n < 1000
- The EVM results of DSSS ModAcc measurement is then computed using the following
 equations from the standard specifications.

### IQ Impairments

IQ impairments are caused by the mismatch between the analog components of in-phase and
 quadrature paths in the RF chain. IQ impairments are characterized by three quantities,
 namely IQ gain imbalance, quadrature skew and timing skew.

[IMAGE alt='image' src='GUID-78F2DF20-75D8-42BA-9D86-83D2D21DCF21-a5.png']

- IQ gain imbalance (dB) is the amount of amplifier and filter gain imbalance between
 I and Q signals. Quadrature skew (deg) is the deviation in angle from 90 degrees
 between the I and Q signals.
- Timing skew (s) is the difference in sampling instances of I and Q signals.
- Both timing skew and quadrature skew contribute to the phase mismatch between I and
 Q signals.

The following equation illustrates these quantities.

[IMAGE alt='image' src='GUID-49CB498E-BBC1-414C-AC8E-B80A4AA27C7E-a5.png']

where

- G = 10(IQ Gain Imbalance/20)
- φ is the quadrature skew
- τ is the timing skew
- I'(t) is the impaired in-phase component of the signal
- Q'(t) is the impaired quadrature-phase component of the signal
- I(t) is the ideal in-phase component of the signal

This section explains the configurations and masks that the RFmx WLAN SEM measurement uses

### Spectral Emission Mask (SEM)

RFmx WLAN SEM measurement uses the configurations and masks conforming to *IEEE
 Standard 802.11-2016*, *IEEE Standard P802.11ax/D8.0*, *IEEE
 Standard P802.11be/D7.0*, and *IEEE Standard P802.11bn/D1.3*
 specifications.

This section explains the configurations and masks that the RFmx WLAN SEM measurement uses.

#### Offset Segments

The frequency ranges adjacent to the carrier channels on which some spectral emission mask
 limit is imposed are collectively known as SEM offset segments.

The offset segments are specified by their start and stop frequencies relative to the
 center frequency of the carrier channel. When you set the SEM Mask Type
 property to Standard, the offset segments' start and stop
 frequencies and mask levels are automatically configured according to the Standard
 property and the Channel Bandwidth property, conforming to IEEE Standard specifications.
 Additionally, if you set the Standard property to 802.11n, then
 the OFDM Freq Bandproperty is also considered for automatically
 configuring compliant offset segments.

To manually configure the following properties for each offset segment, set the SEM
 Mask Type property to Custom:

- SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz)
- SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz)
- SEM Offset Sideband
- SEM Offset Rel Limit Start (dB)
- SEM Offset Rel Limit Stop (dB)

The signs of the offset segment relative start and stop frequencies, specified
 by the SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) and SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz) properties
 respectively, are interpreted as shown in the following examples.

| Configured by you | Measurement interpretation of the configuration |
| --- | --- |
| SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) ← +9 MHz SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz) ← +11 MHz | SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) ← 9 MHz SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz) ← 11 MHz |
| SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) ← –11 MHz SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz) ← –9 MHz | SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) ← 9 MHz SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz) ← 11 MHz |
| SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) ← –9 MHz SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz) ← +11 MHz | SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) ← –9 MHz SEM Offset Stop Freq (Hz) ← +11 MHz |

The SEM Offset Rel Limit Start (dB) property and SEM Offset Rel
 Limit Stop (dB) property determine the SEM mask level for each of the
 offset segments. The SEM Offset Rel Limit Start (dB) property and the 
 SEM Offset Rel Limit Stop (dB) property are mask levels for
 the corresponding SEM Offset Start Freq (Hz) and SEM
 Offset Stop Freq (Hz) of the specific offset segment. These mask levels
 are relative to the measured peak power level in the carrier channel.

The resolution bandwidth and video bandwidth for performing the SEM measurement conforms to the
 *IEEE Standard 802.11-2016*, *IEEE Standard P802.11ax/D8.0*,
 *IEEE Standard P802.11be/D7.0*, and *IEEE Standard
 P802.11bn/D1.3* specifications.

#### Preamble Puncturing

In accordance with the specifications in *IEEE Standard P802.11ax/D8.0*,
 *IEEE Standard P802.11be/D7.0* and *IEEE Standard
 P802.11bn/D1.3*, you can configure additional offset segments for the
 following,

- 80 MHz and 160 MHz MU PPDUs in 802.11ax.
- 80 MHz, 160 MHz, and 320 MHz MU PPDUs in 802.11be.
- 80 MHz, 160 MHz, and 320 MHz MU PPDUs in 802.11bn.

In the previous cases, the preamble is punctured (absent) from certain unoccupied 20 Mhz subchannels. To enable automatic configuration of
 such additional offset segments, configure the following properties.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Standard | 802.11ax, 802.11be or 802.11bn |
| Channel Bandwidth (Hz) | 80.000E+6, 160.000E+6 if you set the Standard property to 802.11ax. 80.000E+6, 160.000E+6, 320.000E+6 if you set the Standard property to 802.11be. 80.000E+6, 160.000E+6, 320.000E+6, if you set the Standard property to 802.11bn. |
| OFDM Preamble Puncturing Enabled | True |
| OFDM Preamble Puncturing Bitmap | An integer between 0x1 and 0xF for 80 MHz PPDU, an integer between 0x1 and 0xFF for 160 MHz PPDU, and an integer between 0x1 and 0xFFFF for 320 MHz PPDU |

| OFDM Preamble Puncturing Bitmap | Active 20 MHz Subchannels |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x1 | 0b0000 0001 | –40 MHz to –20 MHz |
| 0x2 | 0b0000 0010 | –20 MHz to 0 MHz |
| 0xE | 0b0000 1110 | –20 MHz to 0 MHz, 0 MHz to 20 MHz, 20 MHz to 40 MHz |

Similarly, for a 160 MHz PPDU, the bitmap interpretation is shown in the following example.

| OFDM Preamble Puncturing Bitmap | Active 20 MHz Subchannels |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x1 | 0b0000 0001 | –80 MHz to –60 MHz |
| 0x2 | 0b0000 0010 | –60 MHz to –40 MHz |
| 0x48 | 0b0100 1000 | –20 MHz to 0 MHz, 40 MHz to 60 MHz |

Similarly, for a 320 MHz PPDU, the bitmap interpretation is shown in the following example.

| OFDM Preamble Puncturing Bitmap | Active 20 MHz Subchannels |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x1 | 0b0000 0000 0000 0001 | –160 MHz to –140 MHz |
| 0x2 | 0b0000 0000 0000 0010 | –140 MHz to –120 MHz |
| 0x148 | 0b0000 0001 0100 1000 | –100 MHz to –80 MHz, –40 MHz to –20 MHz, 0 MHz to 20 MHz |

### Trigger-Based PPDU ModAcc

Trigger-based (TB) PPDU in 802.11ax, 802.11be or 802.11bn is transmitted in response to a
 trigger frame. The trigger frame allocates resources and carries the information
 required to construct a TB PPDU. Hence, the TB PPDU header does not contain Resource
 Unit (RU), Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), and guard interval information. You must
 configure RU and MCS for performing a ModAcc measurement.

The key results of this measurement are Composite RMS EVM Mean, Frequency Error Mean,
 Frequency Error CCDF 10%, Symbol Clock Error Mean, and Unused Tone Error Margin. When
 you set the OFDM Header Decoding Enabled property to True, you
 must configure the following properties:

- MCS Index
- RU Size
- RU Offset/MRU Index
- RU Type
- Distribution Bandwidth (Hz)
- Guard Interval Type
- LTF Size
- PE Disambiguity
- Space Time Stream Offset
- 2xLDPC Enabled
- Number of HE-LTF Symbols
- MU-MIMO LTF Mode Enabled

- source_description: The unused tone error test is an additional modulation accuracy (ModAcc) test for the unoccupied subcarriers in a HE or EHT or UHR TB PPDU, as defined in section 27.3.18.4.4 of IEEE P802.11ax/D8.0 or section 36.3.20.4.4 of IEEE Standard P802.11be/D7.0, or section 38.3.26.4.4 of IEEE Standard P802.11

### Unused Tone Error Measurement

The unused tone error test is an additional modulation accuracy (ModAcc) test for the unoccupied
 subcarriers in a HE or EHT or UHR TB PPDU, as defined in section 27.3.18.4.4 of
 *IEEE P802.11ax/D8.0* or section 36.3.20.4.4 of *IEEE Standard
 P802.11be/D7.0*, or section 38.3.26.4.4 of IEEE Standard P802.11bn/D1.3,
 respectively.

Calculate the unused tone error for each unused 26-tone resource unit (RU) by averaging
 across 26 subcarriers and normalizing the value with the average power in the occupied
 subcarriers.

For example, the RU index for 20 MHz TB PPDU ranges from 0 to 8, with 0 being the left
 most 26-tone RU and 8 being the right most 26-tone RU in the frequency axis. The unused
 tone error mask, with respect to the RU index, is the standard specified maximum limit
 for unused tone error as defined by the following equations.

[IMAGE alt='image' src='GUID-47C35D98-822C-42CE-BA2B-0CBED0800D65-a5.png']

where

- i RU26,start is equal to the occupied RU index if the occupied RU is a 26-tone RU. For
 more information on this index, see Table 27-50 of IEEE P802.11ax/D8.0 
 and Table 36-66 of IEEE P802.11be/D7.0 for other RU sizes.
- r is the occupied RU bandwidth in units of a 26-tone RU.
- i RU26,end is equal to i RU26,start + r − 1.
- m defines the gap in the units of the 26-tone RU to the occupied RU. m is an integer with m = ±1
 being the adjacent 26-tone RUs.
- ε is the relative constellation error for the HE TB PPDU defined in table
 27-49 of IEEE P802.11ax/D8.0 and Table 36-65 of IEEE
 P802.11be/D7.0 .

The standard specifies two limits for UsedToneError. If the transmit
 power is less than or equal to the maximum power of MCS7, a tighter mask is applied on
 the unused tone error. Subsequently, if the transmit power is more than maximum power of
 MCS7, a relaxed mask is applied.

In case of a non-contiguous multiple RU (MRU), the transmit modulation accuracy test for
 the unoccupied subcarriers of the PPDU is performed by constructing the overall relative
 constellation error staircase mask as following.

1. Treat the non-contiguous MRU as a large RU/MRU that does not have an unmodulated
 portion in between multiple RUs. For example, 2 x 996 + 484-tone MRU is treated as 3
 x 996-tone MRU
2. Find the average unused subcarrier error vector magnitude for each unoccupied
 26-tone RU based on the large RU/MRU.
3. Replace the unmodulated portion in between multiple RUs to max (ε – 2, – 38)
 dB.

The following figure is a graphical representation of the unused tone error measurement
 for a 20 MHz 802.11ax TB PPDU with a 52-tone RU at offset 5.

### Vector Averaging

You can use the vector averaging functionality in the OFDMModAcc measurement when testing
 devices like power amplifiers and front-end modules in a test setup that uses an NI
 signal generator for generating an RF stimulus signal for the device-under-test (DUT)
 and an NI signal analyzer to perform measurements on the RF output signal of the DUT.
 You can use vector averaging to reduce the impact of uncorrelated noise on the
 measurement, originating from anywhere in the entire signal path.

Vector averaging averages the acquired I/Q data across averaging counts after aligning
 the data in time and phase. I/Q data for each averaging count is obtained by processing
 I/Q data in a record in a multi-record acquisition. Correction of relative time offsets
 between records may cause the number of samples available for the OFDMModAcc measurement
 to be lesser than the number of samples in a record, depending on the absolute value of
 the maximum time offset between records. Vector averaging assumes that all records are
 aligned in center frequency and sampling frequency.

Therefore, center frequency alignment and sampling frequency alignment are not performed
 on acquired records. You must make sure that the frequency reference is locked between
 the signal generator and the signal analyzer. Assume that s<sub>i</sub>[l] denotes
 acquired I/Q samples of record i for 0 ≤ l < L, where L is the number of samples in a
 record, with 0 ≤ i < N, where N is the
 averaging count. Let s'<sub>i</sub>[m] denote I/Q samples of averaging count
 i after correcting relative time and phase offsets of
 s<sub>i</sub>[l], with 0 ≤ m < M ≤ L, where M is the number of samples available
 for averaging across all averaging counts after alignment. The output samples after
 vector averaging are given by

[IMAGE alt='image' src='GUID-72522C6D-FCC2-459D-9F27-DD1D515C6C8B-a5.png']

The OFDMModAcc measurement is performed on the averaged I/Q data s[m].

Vector averaging reduces uncorrelated noise in the signal. In the vector averaged signal
 s[m], the power ratio of the signal of interest and the uncorrelated noise is increased
 by 10log(N) dB, as compared to the same power ratio in each of the acquired I/Q data
 s<sub>i</sub>[l]. However, after vector averaging, the improvement in the overall
 signal-to-noise ratio and thus the EVM may be limited by correlated noise components
 such as non-linearities. To determine the averaging count, you must check the amount of
 EVM improvement for your device-under-test and test system for different averaging
 counts.

To perform vector averaging, you must set the OFDMModAcc Averaging Type property to
 Vector. You can control time and phase alignment operations
 through the OFDMModAcc Vector Averaging Time Alignment Enabled and OFDMModAcc Vector
 Averaging Phase Alignment Enabled properties, respectively. You can disable time
 alignment if your test setup uses a precise and repetitive triggering mechanism where
 all acquired records are triggered at the same relative position within the signal. You
 can disable phase alignment if you are sharing the LO between the NI signal generator
 and the NI signal analyzer. Disabling time and/or phase alignment may improve the
 measurement time.

In contrast to vector averaging, RMS averaging performs OFDMModAcc measurement on each
 averaging count and then averages the measurement results. RMS averaging can improve the
 standard deviation of the measurement results such as EVM, whereas vector averaging can
 improve the mean value of the measurement results.
