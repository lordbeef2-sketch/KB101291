Pending Removal in Python 3.15
******************************

* "http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler" will be removed along with its
  related "--cgi" flag to "python -m http.server".  It was obsolete
  and rarely used.  No direct replacement exists.  *Anything* is
  better than CGI to interface a web server with a request handler.

* "importlib":

  * "load_module()" method: use "exec_module()" instead.

* "locale": "locale.getdefaultlocale()" was deprecated in Python 3.11
  and originally planned for removal in Python 3.13 (gh-90817), but
  removal has been postponed to Python 3.15. Use "locale.setlocale()",
  "locale.getencoding()" and "locale.getlocale()" instead.
  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in gh-111187.)

* "pathlib": "pathlib.PurePath.is_reserved()" is deprecated and
  scheduled for removal in Python 3.15. From Python 3.13 onwards, use
  "os.path.isreserved" to detect reserved paths on Windows.

* "platform": "java_ver()" is deprecated and will be removed in 3.15.
  It was largely untested, had a confusing API, and was only useful
  for Jython support. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-116349.)

* "sysconfig":

  * The *check_home* argument of "sysconfig.is_python_build()" has
    been deprecated since Python 3.12.

* "threading": Passing any arguments to "threading.RLock()" is now
  deprecated. C version allows any numbers of args and kwargs, but
  they are just ignored. Python version does not allow any arguments.
  All arguments will be removed from "threading.RLock()" in Python
  3.15. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-102029.)

* "typing.NamedTuple":

  * The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating "NamedTuple"
    classes ("NT = NamedTuple("NT", x=int)") is deprecated, and will
    be disallowed in 3.15. Use the class-based syntax or the
    functional syntax instead.

* "types":

  * "types.CodeType": Accessing "co_lnotab" was deprecated in **PEP
    626** since 3.10 and was planned to be removed in 3.12, but it
    only got a proper "DeprecationWarning" in 3.12. May be removed in
    3.15. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-101866.)

* "typing":

  * When using the functional syntax to create a "NamedTuple" class,
    failing to pass a value to the *fields* parameter ("NT =
    NamedTuple("NT")") is deprecated. Passing "None" to the *fields*
    parameter ("NT = NamedTuple("NT", None)") is also deprecated. Both
    will be disallowed in Python 3.15. To create a "NamedTuple" class
    with 0 fields, use "class NT(NamedTuple): pass" or "NT =
    NamedTuple("NT", [])".

* "typing.TypedDict": When using the functional syntax to create a
  "TypedDict" class, failing to pass a value to the *fields* parameter
  ("TD = TypedDict("TD")") is deprecated. Passing "None" to the
  *fields* parameter ("TD = TypedDict("TD", None)") is also
  deprecated. Both will be disallowed in Python 3.15. To create a
  "TypedDict" class with 0 fields, use "class TD(TypedDict): pass" or
  "TD = TypedDict("TD", {})".

* "wave": Deprecate the "getmark()", "setmark()" and "getmarkers()"
  methods of the "wave.Wave_read" and "wave.Wave_write" classes. They
  will be removed in Python 3.15. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in
  gh-105096.)
